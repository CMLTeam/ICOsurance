**What problem are you trying to solve?:**

_The project is aimed to provide the insurance solution to ICO investors against possible losses due to cyber-attacks during the ICO process._
 
Nowadays lots of ICOs suffer from cyber-security attacks. To name a few during last days:
- Parity Multisig Wallet Hack that affected 3 ICOs ($30m investors' money loss)
- CoinDash crowdfunding hack ($7m of investors money went to attacker's wallet)

We propose the enhanced standard for smart-token contracts (on top of ERC20) that has an insurance logic built-in.

_What this project IS NOT_

- This is not an insurance to the possible loss due to market price changes (volatility)
- This is not an insurance against fraud/scam ICOs. It's responsibility of an investor to properly assess a project to invest in.

**Why do you think Blockchain/SmartContract may be the right approach?:**
- [Eating your own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) - use blockchain itself to protect blockchain
- all the logic is implemented as smart contract and operates on crypto-currency only (no fiat) so no risks due to volatility involved

**API/DATA/Gadget you are thinking about using:** 
Ethereum, [ERC20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard), mock data (real data in future).

**What area do you need help on?:**
Insurance specialists
